# En-vision.io
Envision aims to create a new social and technological infrastructure for users to make effective trading decisions with total information on hand.
We combine machine learning and human intelligence to analyze market trends and news of coins/tokens.
Hybrid Intelligence is the combination of human intelligence and machine intelligence, and their interaction in resolving various tasks.
PROBLEM
The rate at which new information in the market reaches traders can dynamically vary, based on a broad range of differing variables.
It is more than commonly so that the earliest traders who gain access to new information about a new coin or a new trend are the ones who benefit the most in the market.
By the time an average trader finds out about a new coin or trend, it is almost always too late to be in a position where one could maximize their gains.
SOLUTION
By using Hybrid intelligence, a combination of human intelligence and machine intelligence, both will interact to give our users the best information and calls possible on potential ‘moon-shot’ trades.
The two forms of intelligence combined will look for movements in the market along with breaking news regarding a particular token, presenting early calls/trades based on this information. 
Our algorithm also analyzes a coin’s gain in volume, price, and liquidity, notifying our users with this information in real time about these changes.
Envision’s goal is to provide our users an opportunity to be in the best possible position in any given trade, by being first to learn about new market data, analytics, and information.
